# User Testing Example Questions

### Getting Started - prepping the user
* This is not to test **you** as a user. This design is in progress so there will definitely be issues, and you'll help us find them.


* You can ask questions about how things work or what something is for, but I may not answer them right away. This will help us understand how to make the product better, and I'll answer any other questions you have at the end

* You won't hurt my feelings with anything you say about this project. Your feedback will help me make this a better product and avoid having this interface confuse people in the future.


### General
* What do you think this app does?
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this app?

### Specific Screen
* What are you looking at on this screen?
* Could you explain what you think everything on the screen does?

### Specific Workflow
* Let's say you wanted to edit a mistake in this time tracking entry. How would you try to edit the duration from 100 minutes to 10 minutes?
* What would you do to edit your profile information? (from a different screen)

### Market
* Would you use this App? Why? Why not?
* On a scale of 1-10 how likely is it that you would recommend this product to a friend or colleague?


#### Other tips:

* Don't be so eager to break awkward silences. Often the most useful information comes after long pauses
* Your initial goal is to get inside the testee's head and understand how they see your app
* DO NOT be defensive or try to jusify why the app works a certain way. Just listen and learn.
